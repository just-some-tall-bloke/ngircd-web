	ngIRCd
</h2>
<p>
	ngIRCd is a free, portable and lightweight Internet Relay Chat server
	for small or private networks, developed under the GNU General Public
	License
	(<a href="doc/COPYING" hreflang="en">GPL</a>).
</p>
<p>
	The server is quite easy to configure, can handle dynamic IP addresses,
	and optionally supports IDENT, IPv6 connections, SSL-protected links,
	and PAM for user authentication as well as character set conversion for
	legacy clients. The server has been written from scratch and is not
	based on the <q>forefather</q>, the daemon of the IRCNet.
</p>
<p>
	The name <em>ngIRCd</em> means <em>next-generation IRC daemon</em>,
	which is a little bit exaggerated: <em>lightweight Internet Relay Chat
	server</em> most probably would have been a better name :-)
</p>
<h2 id="why">

<h2>
	Simplicity
</h2>
<p>
	ngIRCd supports
	<a href="doc/Platforms.txt">a whole range</a>
	of platforms: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, but
	ngIRCd also runs on Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and other Unices.
</p>
<p>
	After the installation of ngIRCd, which is executed via packet
	installation or configure-make-make-install, and once you have edited
	the ngircd.conf, you can get started after 5 minutes&nbsp;â€“ only a
	few lines need adapting, the rest is purely optional.
